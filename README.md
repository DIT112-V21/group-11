### What you are going to make?

We will make an application that allows us to run the car with a controller (e.g. Xbox controller or PlayStation controller). We will also make a game mode (time trial), you are to drive as far as possible during the set time.

### Why will you make it?

Because at a time like this we need some kind of entertainment. 

### What problem does it solve?

to help with the ongoing covid-19 boredom.


### How you are going to make it?

By mapping the inputs of the controller to actions that the car will take. The time trail starts and you have to drive as far as you possibly can during the time given when you are given the distance you got.

### What kind of technology you are going to use?

We are using a controller (e.g. Xbox controller or PlayStation controller), as well as a computer to run the software on. We have looked into using different tools for handling the controller's inputs.
